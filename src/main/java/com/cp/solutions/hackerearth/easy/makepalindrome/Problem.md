There is a string that consists of lowercase english alphabets and we have to make the string a palindrome
For this, we have
types of operations
1. Re-arrange the string however you want (this operation is free)
2. Add a new character to the end of the string (this operation will cost 1Re)

Your task is to calculate the minimum amount of money to make the string a palindrome

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer
the number of test cases
The first line of every test case consists of
, the length of the string
The second line of every test case contains string


Output Format:
For every test case output one integer, the minimum amount of money required to make the string a palindrome

Constraints:

`1<=T<=100`

`1<=N<=10^5`

Sample Input

* 1
* 4
* aabb

Sample Output

0

Explanation

Here we can re-arrange the string as abba , we need no extra characters to make this a palindrome
