To solve this problem, the key insight is to maximize the number of disjoint palindromic subsequences by efficiently using the characters of the string.

Approach

	1.	Frequency Count:
	•	Count the frequency of each character in the string using a frequency array or hash map.
	2.	Form Palindromes:
	•	For a character with a frequency f, the number of disjoint palindromic subsequences it can form is f // 2 (pairs of the same character form a palindrome).
	•	Add these counts across all characters.
	3.	Output Result:
	•	The result for each test case is the sum of all the counts from the above step.

This approach ensures that each character is used at most once in forming a palindrome, fulfilling the constraint that each character can belong to at most one palindromic subsequence.

Implementation

Explanation of Sample Input and Output

Input:

2
aaad
fdffd

Processing:

	1.	For "aaad":
	•	Frequencies: {'a': 3, 'd': 1}
	•	Maximum palindromes: 3 // 2 = 1 (using two as to form “aa”).
	•	Result: 1.
	2.	For "fdffd":
	•	Frequencies: {'f': 2, 'd': 3}
	•	Maximum palindromes: 2 // 2 = 1 (using two fs to form “ff”) and 3 // 2 = 1 (using two ds to form “dd”).
	•	Result: 2.

Output:

1
2

Complexity Analysis

	1.	Time Complexity:
	•	Counting frequencies: O(|S|) per test case.
	•	Summing palindromes: O(26) (or O(128) for extended ASCII).
Total: O(\text{sum of lengths of all test case strings}).
2.	Space Complexity:
•	Frequency dictionary requires O(26) (or O(128)) space.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints of up to 100 strings, each with a length of up to 10^4.
