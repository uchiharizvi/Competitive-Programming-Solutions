There is a string that consists of lowercase english alphabets, and we have to make the string a palindrome
For this, we have 2 types of operations
1. Re-arrange the string however you want (this operation is free)
2. Add a new character to the end of the string (this operation will cost 1Re)

Your task is to calculate the minimum amount of money to make the string a palindrome

**Input Format:**
1. The first line contains one integer **_T_** the number of test cases
2. The first line of every test case consists of N , the length of the string
3. The second line of every test case contains string S

**Output Format:**
For every test case output one integer, the minimum amount of money required to make the string a palindrome

**Constraints:**

`1<=T<=100`

`1<=N<=10^5`

| Sample Input | Sample Output |
|--------------|---------------|
| 1            | 0             |
| 4            |               |
| aabb         |               |


**Explanation**

Here we can re-arrange the string as abba , we need no extra characters to make this a palindrome
